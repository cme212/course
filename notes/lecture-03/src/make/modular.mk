# Simplest possible makefile
#
# Basic component of each makefile looks like this
# <target> : <dependencies>
# (tab) <rule>
#
# The (tab) charcter has special meaning in make. It denotes beginning
# of a rule.
# 
# Break compilation to separate objects. The first rule is executed first.
# Then, make looks for rules to build the dependencies, starting from the
# next rule down. 
#

# Target clean is not a file. Don't check its modification time, always execute
