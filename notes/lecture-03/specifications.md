## Specifications and Doxygen

Specifications inform a user about a class or function, but do not refer
to its internal workings. That is, a specification will refer to abstract
behavior and not private implementation properties.

In this class, we will use Doxygen comment style specifications.
Doxygen is a tool for generating HTML or PDF documentation from comments
in the source code. To get a quick start with Doxygen, take a look at
[Documenting the Code](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
section of the Doxygen manual.

Let us take a look at the Doxygen formatted comments in front of a C++ function:
```c++
/**
 * @brief <BRIEF DESCRIPTION>
 *
 * @param <NAME> <DESCRIPTION>
 * @tparam <NAME> <DESCRIPTION>
 * @return <DESCRIPTION OF RETURN VALUE>
 *
 * @pre <PRECONDITION>
 * @post <POSTCONDITION>
 *
 * LONGER DESCRIPTION, RUNTIME, EXAMPLES, ETC 
 */
bool signature(of& my_method)
```
In this example:
* Doxygen comment is denoted by opening block comment with `/**`. This tells Doxygen engine
to parse the block comment.
* `@brief` marks the text that will be displayed in summaries and index lists. Typically you would put here a few words description
of your function.
* `@param` describes a function parameter and takes an optional direction: `@param[in]` means the parameter's value is only read and not modified within the function, `@param[out]` means the parameter is not read and is only modified, and `@param[in,out]` means the parameter is both read and modified.
* `@pre` and `@post` define the pre- and postconditions, which should be precise but brief. When in doubt, attempt rigorous conditions but keep in mind that some concepts such as "validity" may be difficult or impossible to define precisely. Specifications are primarily for human consumption.
* `@param`, `@pre`, and `@post` sections should be repeated as many time as required.
* In any section, a parameter can be referred to by name with underscores, e.g. `_paramname_`. This helps disambiguate short parameter names by identifying them in the text and highlighting them in the Doxygen output. For instance, 
```c++
 * @return The size of _a_
```
is clearer than 
```c++
 * @return The size of a
```
when read in plain text and in formatted documentation.

*Note*: Older versions of Doxygen used command `@a` to change the font of the following word
to italics. Since newer versions of Doxygen support markdown syntax, it is recommended to
use `_ ... _` instead of `@a ...` to italicise text. 

To refer to values that change during the operation of the method we use `old X` and `new X`. Here, `old X` (where `X` may be a parameter, global variable, member variable, etc) refers to the value of `X` at the point of call, before the function executes, while `new X` refers to the value of `X` at the point of return, immediately after the function executes. For instance, postconditions will often define `new X` in terms of `old X`. 

To refer to a function's return value we use `result`.

## Specifications and Binary Search Example ##

We describe these concepts in the context of a particular example: binary search. Let's start with the first implementation provided in [search0.cpp](src/binary_search/search0.cpp):
```c++
int binary_search(float* a, int n, float v) {
  int low = 0;
  int high = n-1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (a[mid] < v)
      low = mid + 1;
    else if (a[mid] > v)
      high = mid - 1;
    else
      return mid;   // Value found
  }
  return -1;        // Value not found
}
```
There is a bug in this code that often goes undetected. In the computation of `mid`, if the sum of low and high is greater than `2^{31}-1`, then the `int` type will overflow without warning! To fix this common mistake, we can replace that line with
```c++
int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
```

We want our coworkers to use our method without having to understand every detail of our implementation. In order for this to be feasible, we should write out specifications for `binary_search` that give more information about the inputs and the return value:
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param a  Sorted array of floats.
 * @param n  Number of elements of _a_ to search.
 * @param v  Value to find in _a_.
 * @return   An index into array _a_ or -1.
 */
```
In the above specification, we've used `_a_` in our Doxygen-style comments to emphasize the parameters within each statement.

But this isn't complete! `binary_search` assumes a number of things about it's inputs. These are preconditions -- statements about the inputs that must be true before the function is even called. An obvious precondition restricts the values of `n` that are allowed:
```c++
 * @pre 0 <= n <= Size of _a_.
```
Note that even this simple statement is doing something interesting: appealing to abstract information about the array that the function does not have access to! By using a pointer to pass the array of values, the true size of the array is not accessible. Still, the user must guarantee this precondition is satisfied before using our function.

A more slippery precondition is that binary search assumes array `a` is sorted. Let's add this precondition to our specification:
```c++
 * @pre Array _a_ is sorted.
```
But this isn't good enough either! The array has to be in a specific order. For instance, if the array were sorted in descending numeric order the search will shoot to the wrong end of the array. We need:
```c++
 * @pre Array _a_ is sorted in ascending order.
```
or, more formally and equally as valid:
```c++
 * @pre For all i,j with 0 <= i < j < n, _a_[i] <= _a_[j].
```
In order to guarantee that our function will work, the user must satisfy the two preconditions.

Alright, what about postconditions for `binary_search`? Postconditions are statements that must be true after a piece of code has been run. What statements must the result of a sane binary search function satisfy? The obvious statement is
```c++
 * @post Either _a_[result] == _v_ or result == -1.
```
We use `result` here to denote the return value of the function. This avoids having to refer to the internal implementation of `binary_search` -- a specification should never refer to `mid`, for example. The specification of a function should be _independent of its implementation_.

The postcondition above is not sufficient though... Consider the following implementation of `binary_search`:
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param a  Sorted array of floats.
 * @param n  Number of elements of _a_ to search.
 * @param v  Value to search for.
 * @return   An index into array _a_ or -1.
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= n <= Size of _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with 0 <= i < j < _n_, _a_[i] <= _a_[j].
 * @post Either _a_[result] == _v_ or result == -1.
 */
int binary_search(float* a, int n, float v) {
  return -1;
}
```
This satisfies the postcondition! It is a valid implementation given our specification! Oops.

The problem *is not* that our function is implemented incorrectly. Given
the specifications it is correct. Period. The problem is that the 
postcondition does not sufficiently constrain the implementation of the 
function. Ok, a better postcondition:
```c++
 * @post _a_[result] == _v_ or (result == -1 and _v_ is not in _a_).
```
or even more formally,
```c++
 * @post _a_[result] == _v_ 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. 0 <= _i_ < _n_ and _a_[i] == _v_).
```
In class, we also mentioned the weird possibility of `result` being chosen outside of the bounds of the array. To fully cover our bases, we found the following post-condition to be the strongest and most descriptive:
```c++
 * @post (0 <= result < _n_ and _a_[result] == _v_) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. 0 <= _i_ < _n_ and _a_[i] == _v_).
```
Does this finally sufficiently constrain our function? Well... how about this implementation:
```c++
int binary_search(float* a, int n, float v) {
  a[0] = v;
  return 0;
}
```
This can be repaired: we need to insure that the array is immutable. By changing the signature of the function and, in our specifications, noting that each parameter is read-only, we can promise to the user (and the compiler!) that we will not change the values within the array. A final, solid version of `binary_search` might look like this (see also [search1.cpp](src/binary_search/search1.cpp)):
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param[in] a  Sorted array of floats.
 * @param[in] n  Number of elements of _a_ to search.
 * @param[in] v  Value to search for.
 * @return    An index into array _a_ or -1.
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= n <= Size of the array  _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with 0 <= i < j < n,  a[i] <= a[j].
 * @post (0 <= result < n and  a[result] == v) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t  0 <= i <  n, and  a[i] ==  v).
 *
 * The complexity of the serach algorithm is O(log(n))
 */
int binary_search(const float* a, int n, float v)
{
  int low = 0;
  int high = n-1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (a[mid] < v)
      low = mid + 1;
    else if (a[mid] > v)
      high = mid - 1;
    else
      return mid; // Value found
  }
  return -1;      // Value not found
}
```

## Invariants ##

An **invariant** is a statement that is always true at a particular point in the code. Stating and enforcing invariants within code are useful for catching bugs and generally reasoning about code behavior.

A **precondition** is an invariant that holds when a function is called. A function's precondition is a part of the contract with the users and constrains its caller: if the caller does not obey the precondition, then all bets are off and the function can do whatever it likes.

A **postcondition** is an invariant that holds when a function returns, provided all preconditions were met. A function's postcondition is the other part of the contract with the users but constrains the function itself: assuming the caller obeyed the precondition, the function must ensure that the postcondition holds.

Implicit preconditions and postconditions don't need to be stated. All functions have the implicit precondition that memory has not been corrupted. All functions have the implicit postcondition that they don't modify seemingly-unrelated state; for instance, if a function modifies a global variable, this should be listed explicitly in the specification.

An **assertion** is a checked invariant. The command 
```c++
assert(X);
```
checks that `X` is true, and aborts the program if `X` is false. Not all invariants can or should be checked with assertions. For instance, verifying that the input array is sorted has _O_(_n_) complexity, while our specification promises _O_(log(_n_)) complexity for our function. Assertions should generally be side-effect free -- they should not modify program state. This is so they can be turned off for production code.



## Generic Programming ##

Let's start with the binary search function we defined in the previous section.
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param[in] a   Sorted array of floats.
 * @param[in] n   Number of elements of _a_ to search.
 * @param[in] v   Value to search for.
 * @return    An index into array _a_ or -1.
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= n <= Size of the array _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with 0 <= i < j < _n_, _a_[i] <= _a_[j].
 * @post (0 <= result < _n_ and _a_[result] == _v_) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. 0 <= _i_ < _n_ and _a_[i] == _v_).
 *
 * The complexity of the serach algorithm is O(log(n))
 */
int binary_search(const float* a, int n, float v) 
{
  int low = 0;
  int high = n-1;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (a[mid] < v)
      low = mid + 1;
    else if (a[mid] > v)
      high = mid - 1;
    else
      return mid;   // Value found
  }
  return -1;        // Value not found
}
```
In class, we pointed out limitations of the above implementation. Namely,

* `binary_search` is only called on full arrays, or at least on ranges `0,...,n-1` of an array.
* `binary_search` only applies to a specific type, namely `float`. Writing one function for each type is undesirable.
* `binary_search` only applies to arrays that are sorted in ascending order. What about descending order, lexicographical order, etc?
* `binary_search` only applies to data stored in an array.

A simple modification addresses the first point (see [search2.cpp](src/binary_search/search2.cpp)). 
The complete specification for the modified code is:
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param[in] a         Sorted array of floats.
 * @param[in] low,high  Search in the index range [low, high).
 * @param[in] v         Value to search for.
 * @return    An index into array _a_ or -1.
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= low < high <= Size of the array _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with low <= i < j < high, _a_[i] <= _a_[j].
 * @post (low <= result < high and _a_[result] == _v_) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. 0 <= _i_ < _n_ and _a_[i] == _v_).
 *
 * The complexity of the serach algorithm is O(log(high - low))
 */
int binary_search(const float* a, int low, int high, float v)
```
To address the second point, we note that the body of the function (and the complete specification) applies equally well to numeric types: `int`, `unsigned`, `float`, `double`. Using C++ templates (parametric polymorphism), we replace this function with a function template that allows
compiler to create a `binary_search` function for (nearly) any type:
```c++
/** 
 * @brief Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 *
 * @param[in] a         Sorted array to search.
 * @param[in] low,high  Search in the index range [low, high).
 * @param[in] v         Value to search for.
 * @return    An index into array _a_ or -1.
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= low < high <= Size of the array _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with low <= i < j < high, _a_[i] <= _a_[j].
 * @post (low <= result < high and _a_[result] == _v_) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. 0 <= _i_ < _n_ and _a_[i] == _v_).
 *
 * The complexity of the serach algorithm is O(log(high - low))
 */
template <typename T>
int binary_search(const T* a, int low, int high, const T& v)
{
  --high;
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (a[mid] < v)
      low = mid + 1;
    else if (a[mid] > v)
      high = mid - 1;
    else
      return mid;   // Value found
  }
  return -1;        // Value not found
}
```
The parameter `T` takes over the roll of the previously constant `float` type. The compiler detects which type `T` we need and stamps out the appropriate function for us! 
We have not changed the body of the function because it applies equally well when `T` is an `int`, `unsigned`, `float`, `double`, etc.
```c++
int* a_i = ...;
int idx = binary_search(a_i, 0, n, 5);     // Generates binary_search(int*, int, int, int)
float* a_f = ...;
idx = binary_search(a_f, 0, n, 3.2f);      // Generates binary_search(float*, int, int, float)
idx = binary_search(a_f, 0, n, 3.2);       // Error: conflicting types for parameter 'T'
idx = binary_search<float>(a_f, 0, n, 3.2) // Generates binary_search(float*, int, int, float)
```
The `const T&` change in the above function is to prevent a copy in the case that `T` is a heavy object that would be expensive to copy. For example, `binary_search` now works with `std::string` objects because ` bool operator<(const std::string&, const std::string&)` is implemented in the standard library to perform lexicographical comparison! 
In fact, the family of functions we defined can take on an infinite number of instantiations. 
The code will compile and function properly so long as the type `T` can be compared.
In other words, operators
```c++
bool operator<(const T& a, const T& b);
bool operator>(const T& a, const T& b);
```
must be defined for type `T`. Let's document the requirement of type
`T`. 
```c++
/** 
 * Search a sorted array for a value using binary search.
 * 
 * @param[in] a         Sorted array to search.
 * @param[in] low,high  Search in the index range [ low,  high).
 * @param[in] v         Value to search for.
 * @return    An index into array _a_ or -1.
 *
 * @tparam T Type of the array elements. Following operators must be defined:
 *             - Comparison   `bool operator<(T,T)`
 *             - Comparison   `bool operator>(T,T)`
 * 
 * @pre 0 <= low <= high <= Size of the array _a_.
 * @pre For all i,j with  low <= i < j < high,  a[i] <= a[j].
 * @post ( low <= result <  high and  a[result] ==  v within tolerance eps) 
 *    or (result == -1 and there is no _i_ s.t. low <= i < high, and a[i] == v).
 *
 * The complexity of the serach algorithm is O(high - low)
 */
template <class T>
int binary_search(const T* a, int low, int high, const T& v)
```
Full implementation in provided in [search3.cpp](src/binary_search/search3.cpp).

Note: A function template alone cannot be compiled because it does not contain a
complete definition of a function. Because of that, templates are typically coded
in header files.

We notice that if we slightly modify function `binary_search`, we can
reduce the requirements on the type `T`. Let us rewrite the conditional
statements as:
```c++
    if (a[mid] < v)      // a[mid] < v
      low = mid + 1;
    else if (v < a[mid]) // a[mid] > v
      high = mid - 1;
    else
      return mid;
```
Now, type `T` needs to implement only "less than" operator.
The `binary_search` function can operate on _any_ data type that implements
this operator. Fewer requirements makes implementation of user-defined types
easier and less error-prone.

Let us use `binary_search` with `Student` class defined in
[student.hpp](src/binary_search/student.hpp), and let us try to find a student
in a classroom by their name. The `Student` class does not have
default comparison operator, so we have to define them:
```c++
bool operator<(const Student& x, const Student& y)
{
  return (x.getName() < y.getName());
}
```
Here we rely on `std::string` comparison. With these
definitions, we can find a student in the classroom, provided the
classroom meets our preconditions:
```c++
  Student classroom[10];
  ...
  Student* john = new Student("Cleese, John", 100400);
  ...
  int seat = binary_search(classroom, 0, 3, *john);
```
The full code is in [search4.cpp](src/binary_search/search4.cpp). This is really
powerful. With minor coding effort we were able to deploy our `binary_search`
code for a quite different use case.
