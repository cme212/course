## Loop Invariants

We can use some of the same tools for reasoning about loops as we have used for classes and
methods: preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.

First, let's note that our standard for-loop consists of some first/setup statements `F`, a
predicate `P`, a next statement `N`, and body `S`:
```c++
for (F; P; N)
  S;
```
is equivalent to the while loop:
```c++
F;
while (P) {
  S; N;
}
```

To reason about this loop's behavior, we will add preconditions, postconditions, and a loop
invariant (`LI`) which is always true at the beginning and end of the loop.
```c++
F;
assert (@pre);
assert (LI);
while (P) {
  S; N;
  assert(LI);
}
assert (@post);
```
Or, diagrammatically:

From the code and diagram, we can see that our loop invariant will always be true if:

1: `@pre => LI`

2: `P+S=>LI`

and our postcondition will be satisfied if:

3: `(LI && !P) => @post`

Let us apply this reasoning to some code for computing the greatest common divisor.
```c++
 int a = orig_a;
 int b = orig_b;
 /* @pre: a >= 1,b >= 1 */
 while(a != b)
 {
   /* LI: a, b both divisible by gcd(orig_a, orig_b) */
   if(a > b)
     a = a - b;
   else /*b > a */
     b = b - a;
   /*LI: a, b both divisible by gcd(orig_a, orig_b) */
 }
 /* @post: gcd(orig_a, orig_b) ==a */
```
We satisfy requirement (1) `@pre => LI` by the definition of the GCD. We can reason that
requirement (2) `P + S => LI` is satisfied because if both `a` and `b` are divisible by GCD
and `(a-b)>0`, then `(a-b)` must also be divisible by GCD; to put it differently, whatever the GCD of `a` and `b` is (possibly one), since it's a divisor of both numbers we must be able to count in increments of the GCD from lesser values `b` to greater valued `a`. A similar argument can be made for
the case when `(b-a)>0`: the difference between the two values is divisible by the GCD of the pair. Finally, for requirement (3), if `(LI && !P)` is true, then we know
that both `a` and `b` are divisible by the GCD and `(a==b)`, so `a` must be equal to the GCD.
If the precondition and postcondition are satisfied, we know the loop will exit with the correct
result, but we havenâ€™t said anything about it actually exiting, yet. To reason about the loop
actually terminating, we add a decrementing function `DF`, with the requirement that `DF(X)`
decreases each iteration, and that:

4: `(P && LI) => DF(X+S) < DF(X)`

5: `(DF(X) == min) => !P`

where `X` is the program state, and in the first statement, `DF(X)` is the decrementing function
before `S` is executed, and `DF(X + S)` is its value afterward, and `min` is some minimum value
for `DF(X)`.

What `DF` should we use for the GCD example? Each loop must reduce `DF(X)`,
and it must reach some minimum value. A natural choice for `DF(X)` is `max(a,b)-GCD(a,b)`,
with `X=a,b` and `min==0`.

We satisfy (4) `(P && LI) => DF(X) < DF(X + S)` by the argument that decrementing the
larger of `a` or `b` lowers `max(a,b)`. Finally, if `DF(X)==0`, this means that `max(a,b)==GCD(a,b)`
which must mean that `a==b`, i.e., `!P`.

Hint: always use natural numbers for your `DF`, with a minimum of 0, to simplify reasoning
about loops.
