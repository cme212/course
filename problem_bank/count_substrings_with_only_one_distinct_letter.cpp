/* Given a string S, return the number of substrings that have only one distinct letter.

   Example 1:
   Input: S = "aaaba"
   Output: 8
   Explanation: The substrings with one distinct letter are "aaa", "aa", "a", "b".
   "aaa" occurs 1 time.
   "aa" occurs 2 times.
   "a" occurs 4 times.
   "b" occurs 1 time.
   So the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8.
   
   Example 2:
   Input: S = "aaaaaaaaaa"
   Output: 55
